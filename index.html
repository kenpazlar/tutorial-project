   <p><strong>Kombucha</strong> is a flavored bacterial tea with many health benefits, and a variety of flavors. </p>
   <p> It's reletively easy to make at home, but realize its going to take some time to ferment.</p>
   <p>In the end costing much less than a storebought product and individualizing it to your particular taste.</p>


   <h1>Ingredients needed:</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>1) Black or green tea. Do not use flavored tea, it ruins the fermentation process.</li>
    <li>2) SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) mother culture, this is a live yeast bacteria culture and 1/2 cup of already brewed kombucha.</li>
    <li>3) One or two cups of organic cane sugar</li>
    <li>4) 4 large quart bottles with airtight stoppers and 1 large clean metal pot.</li>
    <li>5) Cheesecloth and rubber bands.</li>
    <li>6) Flavorings(ginger to rosemary, blueberry to lemon), personal choice.

     <h1>Getting started:</h1>
     <li>1) Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in pot. Let boil at least 1 minute.
     </li>
     <li>2)Remove pot from water add 1 to 2 cups organic cane sugar, dissolve thoughrally.</li>
     <li>3) Let cool down to 88 degress. Any warmer it will kill the SCOBY. Add the SCOBY and 1/2 cup kombucha.</li>
     <li>4) Pour into large glass jar and cover with cheesecloth, secure with rubber band. it must be able to breathe.</li>
     <li>5) Place jar in dark warm place to begin fermentation. This will take anywhere from 7 days to 20 days. The less time spent fermenting the sweeter the tea.</li>


     <li>6) After a few days a new SCOBY will begin to appear. It looks ugly, but as long as it doesnt turn black or smell bad, it's ok.</li>

 <li>7) Once your tea is fermented to where you want it, it's time to flavor it. Remove the SCOBY. Pour the tea into the 4 quart bottles.</li>
 <li>8) Add to the tea fruit juice, pulverized fresh fruit, herbs or roots. Or any flavors you want. </li>
 <li>The flavored tea must now be placed back in dark warm place for three more days, for a second fermentation. The bottles must be sealed air tight during this time and will become fizzy. </li>
 </ul>
